I'm an R&D Engineer working on applying ML to the voice synthesis, compression, and recognition space. Currently working on a communication device called [Relay](https://www.relaygo.com).

## Background

My background is in physics where I did research in computational quantum mechanics before moving into tech as a Site Reliability Engineer. I transitioned into R&D from there and have worked on problems ranging from indoor location tracking to log anomaly detection with a core focus on voice recognition and synthesis.

## Interests

(In no particular order)

* autoregressive NNs
* manifold learning
* unsupervised/semisupervised learning
* speech synthesis and recognition
* software defined radios
* neural compression
* brain computer interfaces
* NLU/NLP
* embedded systems
* on device ML/DL
* field programmable gate arrays
* distributed systems
